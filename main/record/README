Protocol Recording : 

1. The participant is sitting down on a chair with arms extended in parallel, resting on a table. 
2. Two bottles of water are on the table, approximately 5 cm to the left and right hand. 
3. The participant’s head faces forward, while the eyes rotate to the left or to the right, looking to the bottle. 
4. We asked the participant to imagine picking up the bottle with the left hand, but without 
moving the hand only thinking about it for 5 s. 
5. Then, we asked the participant to relax and to close the eyes for 5 s. 
6. We move the bottle on the right side of the table 
7. The participant repeats steps 3–5, but for right hand motor imagery. 
8. We repeated steps 2–7 for 20 times for each participant.
