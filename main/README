Deep Learning Pipeline: 
After collecting the EEG data directly on the Muse 2 headset, I go through a processing step where the EEG data is converted into an MNE (Magnetoencephalography and Electroencephalography) object to perform various pre-processing operations such as filtering and deleting artifacts. These data are then sent to the CNN-LSTM hybrid AI model. After experimenting with several architectures, this architecture offers the best performance. Indeed, in the hybrid CNN-LSTM model, CNN layers are used upstream to extract spatial features from EEG data, while LSTM layers are used to capture temporal dependencies.
