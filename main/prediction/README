1. Sequencing the prediction window every second: 

=> A window is created every second with the number of samples calculated with the sampling rate of 256 Hz: n_samples = Wn*Fs
Then the model makes a prediction every second.  


2. Sequencing the prediction window every 0.05 s to make 20 predictions per s: 20 frames per s
=> Stream for  1s : delta = 0.05 s
    1. t0 dÃ©but du stream -> t1 fin du stream : 1rst prediction
    2. t0 + delat -> t2 = t1 + delta : 2nd prediction
    3. t0 + 2*delta -> t3 = t1 + 2*delta : 3rd prediction
    . 
    .
    .
    n-1. t0+ (n-2)*delta -> tn-1 = t1 + (n-2)*delta : n-1 prediction
    n. t0 + (n-1)*delta -> tn = t1 + (n-1)*delta : n prediction
